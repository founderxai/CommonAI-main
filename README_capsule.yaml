    title: Commoncy
    subtitle: Infrastructure as a Public Protocol
    highlights:

      - shared access to infrastructure
      - fallbacks that serve the Commons before capital
    quote: "A Commons is not free — it is earned, shared, and stewarded."

    subtitle: Structured Intelligence with Traceable Logic
    highlights:

    quote: "The only intelligence worth deploying is the kind that can justify itself."
