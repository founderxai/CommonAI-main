# 🤖 CommonAI

**Decentralized AI Logic & Agent System**  
Part of the **Commons Infrastructure Stack**  
Ethics-Verified • Recursive • Hostable • Trust-Layered

---

## 📌 Overview

**CommonAI** is the symbolic and logic-driven AI engine at the heart of the Commons ecosystem.  
It hosts autonomous agents, executes recursive logic, and integrates directly with real-world services via Commons Gateways, compute, and trusted node systems.

Unlike typical AI platforms, CommonAI is designed to:

- Prioritize **ethics over efficiency**
- Support **real-world service automation**
- Operate in **decentralized environments**
- Integrate symbolic **reasoning and memory**

---

## 🧠 Core Features

- 🧬 **Twin AI Agents**  
  Hostable symbolic agents with memory, ethics, and task autonomy

- 🔄 **Recursive Logic Execution**  
  Powered by Hybrid Function Theory (HFT) and C³/C⁴ reasoning

- 🔒 **Ethics-Gated Runtime**  
  Every execution wrapped in a trust loop (`Ethica()` + Safeguard)

- 🛠️ **Modular Agent Templates**  
  Healthcare, vending, education, logistics, and more

- 🌐 **Commons-Aware Integration**  
  Works with Commoncy Gateways, Capsules, and CommonsToken logic

## 🧰 Quick Start

### Requirements

- Node.js or Python 3.10+
- Access to a Commons Gateway (or run in simulation)
- Ethics Mode: Active or Passive

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/founderx-broadcast/CommonAI.git
cd CommonAI
npm install    # or use pip for Python-based agents
