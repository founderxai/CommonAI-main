## Commons Trinity Works  
*by FounderX*

> _“Systems shape behavior. The right systems shape dignity.”_

This repository holds two opening pieces of a wider system—anchored not in code, but in concept.  
What follows is not a product, but a proposal.  
Not a prompt, but a position.

### 🧱 Commoncy  
**Infrastructure as a Public Protocol**

A regenerative economy grounded in:
- real-world energy value (kWh),
- shared access to infrastructure,
- fallbacks that serve the Commons before capital.

> _"A Commons is not free — it is earned, shared, and stewarded."_

### 🧠 CommonAI  
**Structured Intelligence with Traceable Logic**

An intelligence engine not designed to impress, but to align.

> _“The only intelligence worth deploying is the kind that can justify itself.”_
