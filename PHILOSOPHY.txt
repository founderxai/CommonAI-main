The Commons Is the System

Four principles define the foundation of the Commons Trinity:

I. Design for Dignity
All logic should be legible. Infrastructure should reward participation and minimize coercion. 
Obscured code is not neutral — it is undemocratic.

II. Intelligence Requires Alignment
No black-box reasoning. Only traceable, ethical computation. Intelligence without coherence is indistinguishable from control.

III. Fiction as Frame
Narrative provides symbolic comprehension. Stories like "The Gospel of C-3PO" serve as scaffolding for system logic made human.

IV. CommonsFiat as Logic
Contribution—not speculation—generates value. In such a system, memory and coherence become the currency of trust.
