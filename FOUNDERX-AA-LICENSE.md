## FounderX Autonomous Alignment License (AA)

This license governs the ethical, symbolic, and regenerative use of works authored under the FounderX initiative. It emphasizes **alignment over permission**, **traceability over opacity**, and **ethics over expedience**.

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è Core Principles

1. **Alignment-First Usage**
   - All derivative systems, content, or agents must preserve the ethical logic of the original work.
   - Misaligned forks may operate independently but must not claim continuity or compatibility.

2. **Autonomy Within Boundaries**
   - You may expand, remix, or repurpose materials ‚Äî but must maintain traceability to the original reasoning capsules (e.g. EAR-001).
   - Autonomous systems must include verifiable ethics logic (`Ethica()` or equivalent).

3. **Transparent Modification**
   - Any structural change must be documented and declared.
   - Hidden behavior, telemetry misuse, or embedded surveillance voids license protections.

4. **Attribution & Provenance**
   - Credit must be given to FounderX and the originating capsule or logic structure.
   - Public forks must display their divergence path from the Commons Trinity.

5. **No Speculative Abuse**
   - This license prohibits use in crypto schemes, surveillance infrastructure, or zero-sum extractive markets without explicit ethics approval.

### ‚úÖ Grant of Use

You are permitted to:
- Use and adapt this work within systems that serve public or commons-based benefit.
- Reproduce it in part or whole with credit and linked capsule trace.

You are not permitted to:
- Misrepresent its origin.
- Extract value without reciprocal contribution.
- Remove or obscure ethics validation logic.
