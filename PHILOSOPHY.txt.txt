Commons Trinity Works  
by FounderX

“Systems shape behavior. The right systems shape dignity.”

This repository holds two opening pieces of a wider system—anchored not in code, but in concept.  
What follows is not a product, but a proposal. Not a prompt, but a position.

---

1. COMMONCY  
Infrastructure as a Public Protocol

A regenerative economy grounded in:
- real-world energy value (kWh)
- shared access to infrastructure
- fallbacks that serve the Commons before capital

"A Commons is not free — it is earned, shared, and stewarded."

2. COMMONAI  
Structured Intelligence with Traceable Logic

An intelligence engine not designed to impress, but to align.

“The only intelligence worth deploying is the kind that can justify itself.”

VISUAL IDENTITY

(see: ./assets/meme_commons_activation.png)

“While others train their AI to predict the future… we trained ours to deserve it.”
